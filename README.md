  This application manages an online shopping database.  It handles the data for Merchants, Customers, and all of the related material for effective e-commerce such as transactions and invoices.
  It allows a user interacting with the front end client to have full crud functionality with the corresponding data sets.

  ###
    To use this application a user would need to clone down our repo by going to <https://github.com/nvnatasha/Little-Shop> .  Once there, click on the code button and copy the ssh.  They can then run git clone in there terminal and paste the ssh.  Once the repo has been cloned they can open it in their code editor.  Once open you will need to follow rails set up commands of bundle install to install all of the available gems.  Then rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed} to reset and load the database followed immediatly by rails db:schema:dump.  The back end api is now ready for use.  run rails s to connect it to the server, and using a connected front end client application it is ready to go.

    This project had a 9 day timeframe.  As a large full stack group project, it added quite a bit as far as complexity, project and time management, and group dynamics.  As a group, we created a project board to clearly seperate work tasks.  As time went we had some group wins and hiccups.  A good mix of full group, paired, and asynch work space.  We kept in very good contact with daily stand up meetings, lots of group slack messages and live zoom meetings.

    As a group we set learning goals to be able to collabrativly participate in both BE and FE development.  Improe testing skills with effective use of mode, validation and sad path testing. And to gain a deeper understanding of MVC design priciples and BE / FE interactions.

  ###
    Making sure the Front End and Back End were connected and communicating as planned was challenging, but very rewarding when successful.  Utilizing Postman for added testing provided some extra learning and problem solving challenges.  Forcing a deeper understanign of really what is happening at all levels of our application. Again, extremely rewarding when successful.
